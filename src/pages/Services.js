            Business Valuation
          </h1>
          <p>
            A Business valuation ascertains the economic assay of a business.
            This process is used to dictate the face value of a business for a
            miscellany of reasons like denoting partner ownership, taxation,
            sale value, and many more. There are distinct methods of valuing a
            business which are done by taking a look at its earnings, book
            value, market capitalization, earnings multipliers, DCF (discounted
            cash flow), liquidation value, etc. Santosh Mishra &amp; Associates
            Chartered Accountants has a team who are well versed with these
            methods and will help you accordingly. Some services under Business
            Valuation that we provide are listed below:

            Feasibility Analysis
          </h3>
          <p>
            A feasibility analysis is designed to uncover whether a business
            plan/project is profitable and feasible. This process deals with the
            practicality of the advocated business plan/project. Financial
            feasibility is the main part as it gives a clear picture of whether
            the investment will earn higher ROI or will be a loss-bearing one.
            Santosh Mishra &amp; Associates Chartered Accountants help you in analyzing
            these steps:
